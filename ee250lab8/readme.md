From the range in green: Cent, Dime
From the range in blue: Nickel, Quarter Dollar
From the range in orange: Dollar

Any sort of measurement is going to have noise in systems. However, excluding noise, coins from different batches or different decades will 
have different mass due to imperfections or alloy density differences. 

I would use a comparison of known ranges to determine the coin values. The values of the coins above are distinct enough to the
average sensor that you could divide them by ranges. For example:

Penny: 2.400 - 2.600g
Nickel: 4.500 - 5.500g
Quarter 5.300 - 5.800g

You could use the grove light sensor and sort by reflectivity.

Dataset A is the only dataset where you can draw a perfectly straight, continuous line and seperate both classes of data
with 100% accuracy.

These equations represent the following:

Circle (centered at h,k)
Two distinct lines (can become parabolic under certain conditions)
Parabola
Ellipse
Rectangular Hyperbola

z = 2 + -2 + 6 -2(bias) = 4
1/1+e^-4 = 0.98 (approx)
